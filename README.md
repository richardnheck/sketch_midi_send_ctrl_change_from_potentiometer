# Arduino UNO sketch: Send midi control change messages from a potentiometer
Using an Arduino Uno (or Uno compatible), send midi control change messages from a potentiometer.  In order to send midi to a DAW, it requires using Hairless Midi Serial and LoopBe.

### Disclaimer
The code was basically generated by ChatGPT, all except for initializing a custom midi instance

## Circuit
All you need to do is connect a potentiometer to Analog Pin A0.

## Dependencies
- Arduino UNO
- Potentiometer
- Arduino IDE
- Midi Library which can be installed easily via the Library Manager https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/midi-library/

## Demo
The screenshot shows the midi control change messages being logged in Hairless Midi Bridge.  You can see that the midi is mapped to LoopBe internal midi.  The DAW being controlled is FLStudio, but any DAW can be used and LoopBe Internal Midi should appear as an input midi device.

You can see that the current value of the control change is 64 which is roughly 50% of the range (i.e 0 -> 127) and in the top left of FL Studio you can see that value SVF High: 50%

Make sure the baud rate is set to 115200, which is the baud rate defined in the code.

### Loop Be 1 - A Free Virtual MIDI Driver

LoopBe1 is an internal MIDI device for transferring MIDI data between computer programs. Basically LoopBe1 is an "invisible cable" to connect a MIDI outport of an application to any other applicationÂ´s MIDI inport.
